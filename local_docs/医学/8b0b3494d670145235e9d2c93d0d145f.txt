作者: Philip J Bergman

摘要: The enhanced understanding of immunology experienced over the last 5 decades afforded through the tools of molecular biology has recently translated into cancer immunotherapy becoming one of the most exciting and rapidly expanding fields. Human cancer immunotherapy is now recognized as one of the pillars of treatment alongside surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The field of veterinary cancer immunotherapy has also rapidly advanced in the last decade with a handful of commercially available products and a plethora of investigational cancer immunotherapies, which will hopefully expand our veterinary oncology treatment toolkit over time.
