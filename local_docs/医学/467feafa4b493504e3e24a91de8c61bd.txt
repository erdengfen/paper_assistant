摘要: Cancer's complexity is in part due to the presence of intratumor heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of cancer cell plasticity, which create substantial obstacles in effective cancer management. Variability within a tumor arises from the existence of diverse populations of cancer cells, impacting the progression, spread, and resistance to treatments. At the core of this variability is the concept of cellular plasticity - the intrinsic ability of cancer cells to alter their molecular and cellular identity in reaction to environmental and genetic changes. This adaptability is a cornerstone of cancer's persistence and progression, making it a formidable target for treatments. Emerging studies have emphasized the critical role of such plasticity in fostering tumor diversity, which in turn influences the course of the disease and the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies. The transformative nature of cancer involves a network of signal transduction pathways, notably those that drive the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metabolic remodeling, shaping the evolutionary path of cancer cells. Despite advancements, our understanding of the precise molecular machinations and signaling networks driving these changes is still evolving, underscoring the necessity for further research. This editorial presents a series entitled "Signaling Cancer Cell Plasticity and Intratumor Heterogeneity" in Cell Communication and Signaling, dedicated to unraveling these complex processes and proposing new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
