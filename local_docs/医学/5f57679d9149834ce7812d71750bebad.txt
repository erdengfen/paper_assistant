摘要: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and rejuvenated the field of tumor immunology. Several types of immunotherapy, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have obtained durable clinical responses, but their efficacies vary, and only subsets of cancer patients can benefit from them. Immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been shown to play a key role in tumor development and will affect the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Comprehensive profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells would shed light on the mechanisms of cancer-immune evasion, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, the highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the TME impedes the precise dissection of intratumoral immune cells. With recent advances in single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry, systematic interrogation of the TME is feasible and will provide insights into the functional diversities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In this review, we outline the recent progress in cancer immunotherapy, particularly by focusing on landmark studies and the recent single-cell characterization of tumor-associated immune cells, and we summarize the phenotypic diversities of intratumoral immune cells and their connections with cancer immunotherapy. We believe such a review could strengthen our understanding of the progress in cancer immunotherapy, facilitate the elucidation of immune cell modulation in tumor progression, and thus guide the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment.
