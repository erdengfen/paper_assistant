标题: Clinical Trial Considerations in Neuro-oncology.

作者: Eudocia Q Lee

摘要: Clinical trials play a critical role in discovering new treatments, but the path to regulatory approval can be cumbersome and time consuming. Efforts to increase the efficiency and interpretability of clinical trials within the neuro-oncology community have focused on standardization of response assessment, development of consensus guidelines for clinical trial conduct, decentralization of clinical trials, removal of barriers to clinical trial accrual, and re-examination of patient eligibility criteria.
