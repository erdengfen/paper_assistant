作者: Eric Tai, Lynda Beaupin, Archie Bleyer

摘要: Survival rates for children with cancer have significantly increased over the past 35 years. However, adolescents with cancer aged 15 to 19 years have had less progress in survival prolongation compared with younger children, which may be due to lower clinical trial enrollment among adolescents with cancer. To help address this issue, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a series of webinars to identify salient issues and measures to address this problem. This supplement is intended to raise awareness about the unique challenges of clinical trial enrollment among adolescents with cancer.
