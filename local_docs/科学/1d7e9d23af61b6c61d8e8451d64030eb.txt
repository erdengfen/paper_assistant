摘要: Energy transition is a global objective. Moving towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources requires the progressive abandonment of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The transition also arises from concerns about climate change and national security that require a more secure and resilient energy system. The European Union aims to be climate neutral by 2050. Key strategies include the European Green Deal, which promotes renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable mobility. Significant investments are supporting the transition, including the Just Transition Fund and the InvestEU programme. Italy is actively participating in the energy transition with the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) prioritising green initiatives. However, challenges remain, especially for island regions. The study proposes a method to compare the monthly trend of the carbon footprint in the islands of Sardinia (Italy), Sicily (Italy) and Cyprus, analyzing data for the period 2021–2024, in respect to the following indicators: direct carbon intensity, percentage of low-carbon energy and energy from renewable sources. The results reveal an overall improvement in renewable energy production across the three islands from 2021 to 2024, with a positive trend towards greater adoption of low-carbon and renewable energy sources. The comparison proved to be valuable for informing policy decisions to support energy transitions in the Mediterranean islands.
