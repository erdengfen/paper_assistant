摘要: Social equity is a fundamental principle of sustainable urban development, emphasising the fair distribution of resources, services, and opportunities to all individuals, regardless of socioeconomic or demographic characteristics. Although many studies utilising social science methods have investigated different aspects of equity in society, the use of Space Syntax analytical method in urban planning has not been well covered in current literature. Space Syntax is a well-established method for analysing spatial configurations and provides particular consistencies to the main indicators of social equity, such as accessibility, connectivity, inclusivity, security, and the equitable distribution of public and green spaces. This study seeks to provide an original methodology linking Space Syntax analysis with the socio-spatial dimensions of social equity in regional contexts. To achieve this, relevant indicators of social equity from a socio-spatial perspective are identified and analysed. The research’s originality is combining spatial analysis with the multidimensional concept of social equity. These results show that the socio-spatial equity indicators and Space Syntax used together provide a useful diagnostic tool for identifying spatial inequality and guiding a fair urban development.
