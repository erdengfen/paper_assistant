摘要: Unplanned urbanization and illegal settlements have, for many years, represented one of the most complex challenges for local administrations in Italy, and they are at the center of strong interest from urban planners. Beyond the legal aspects, these phenomena are seen as sources of territorial disorder and urban imbalance (de Biase, Losco, 2023, p.3). The paper describes sustainable solutions for the regeneration of the settelments illegally built and is divided into five sections, beginning with the definition and quantification of illegal settlements worldwide and in Italy. The extent of this type of settlement highlights the centrality of the issue within the broader challenges of urban regeneration across the globe. Particular focus is placed on the Italian context, examining the regulatory and planning framework in place in the country and in the Campania region. With deep roots in the history of our country, building and urban planning violations have affected numerous municipalities, where entire neighborhoods have sprung up spontaneously and often outside the bounds of legality. The South of Italy, in particular, experiences a state of distress that touches on various aspects, and looking to the future in an effort to improve this condition holds significant meaning, especially at the local level. The social and economic factors driving the expansion of illegal settlements are deeply rooted in the dynamics of exclusion and vulnerability that characterize many areas of Italy. These settlements often arise without building permits, in contexts lacking urban planning and control, and develop without access to essential infrastructures, such as connections to the water supply, sewage systems, and energy services. The focus is on a neighborhood that developed illegally within a municipality in the province of Caserta, an area notably affected by this type of phenomenon. The neighborhood, Campo Sorbo, located in the municipality of Santa Maria Capua Vetere, is analyzed both in terms of urban planning tools and the illegal evolution of its settlements. Campo Sorbo’s construction began to take shape in the early 1980s and has since evolved into a true urban settlement. However, it lacks the necessary infrastructure and services, creating a context of marginalization and hardship for its residents. The last two sections are aimed at the analysis, classification, and design of both the illegal settlements and the agricultural context in which the neighborhood is located. The analyzed neighborhood, like most illegally established neighborhoods, shows a series of characteristics common to this type of area: there is a lack of efficiency in the urban service network, which requires innovation and improvement; there are issues related to the protection of landscapes, historical heritage, and protected natural areas, which are often poorly managed; there is outdated infrastructure that needs upgrading; and finally, the problem of illegal construction still persists, with unclear procedures for the regularization of unauthorized settlements, even in protected areas. Being aware of these challenges is essential in order to demand and design new solutions. These solutions must be incorporated into municipal urban planning policies to effectively address future challenges and improve the overall situation. (Forte, 2012, p. 17). The project currently being developed as part of the urban planning policies of the municipal administration is set within a broader context of recovery and redevelopment. It includes the implementation of primary urban infrastructure—a fundamental step toward integrating the area into the official urban fabric and improving the living conditions of residents, who have so far been disadvantaged by the absence of essential services such as a water supply system, sewage network, and access to electricity. This study aims to propose comprehensive regeneration strategies by exploring the phenomenon of illegal construction through a detailed analysis of the neighborhood, with particular attention to the urban planning policies adopted by the municipal administration. The goal is to outline a methodological approach that takes into account the ongoing social and urban transformations.
