摘要: Plastic waste is an urgent environmental challenge that we must address to protect our precious ecosystems. This chapter dives into the key obstacles preventing ecosystem resilience in the face of rising plastic pollution, shedding light on the serious ecological effects of ongoing plastic buildup and the complexity of this issue. We passionately advocate for integrated solutions to combat plastic pollution, emphasizing innovative materials and responsible alternatives to minimize toxicity. Moreover, we assess the current waste management systems, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, while also pinpointing gaps in policy and infrastructure. Finally, we explore cutting-edge recycling technologies and their pivotal role in fostering a circular economy. It’s clear that coordinated global efforts are essential to reduce plastic-related harm and to champion sustainable waste management practices, and together, we can make a difference.
