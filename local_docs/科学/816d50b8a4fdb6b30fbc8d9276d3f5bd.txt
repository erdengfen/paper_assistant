摘要: This study investigates the implementation of joyful and game-based learning using the Quizizz platform to enhance students’ learning interest and cognitive learning outcomes in the lathe machining subject. A quantitative research approach with a pre-experimental one-group pre-test post-test de-sign was employed. The sample consisted of 24 students from Class XI Mechanical Engineering, who participated in three stages: pre-test, treatment, and post-test. Students’ learning interest was measured using a questionnaire, while cognitive learning outcomes were assessed through multiple-choice tests. The Wilcoxon test results indicated a statistically significant increase in students’ learning interest (p < 0.05), while the paired sample t-test showed a significant improvement in cognitive learning outcomes (t-count = 9.246 > t-table = 1.714). Additionally, the N-Gain test classified the improvements in learning interest (0.539) and cognitive learning out-comes (0.663) as moderate. These findings suggest that game-based learning through Quizizz effectively enhances students’ motivation and learning achievements in technical education. The study highlights the potential of digital learning platforms in vocational education, providing a more engaging and interactive learning experience. Future research should explore the integration of emerging technologies, while leveraging Quizizz’s emerging AI-driven adaptive engine to personalize item difficulty and automatically generate distractors transforming the platform from a static quiz tool into a lightweight intelligent tutoring system for vocational theory.
