摘要: In recent years, the occurrence of some political events around the world, some diseases (e.g. Covid-19) and severe weather events have led decision-makers to consider more about the uncertainty and disruption of the routes available for the distribution of some important agricultural products such as soybeans and corn. This work aims to study some advantageous Supply Chain Networks Design (SCND) for the distribution of soybeans and corn considering the uncertainty in supply, demand and transportation costs on intermodal routes for the distribution of soybeans and corn in Europe and North Africa. The objectives considered are to minimize the costs associated with transportation and distribution, and to consider environmentally friendly solutions as soon as possible, taking into account the carbon footprint (green solutions). Starting from a deterministic model, uncertainty is introduced by considering a set of scenarios, and then the multi-objective version of the model is considered, taking into account the economic and environmental objective functions. The solutions emphasize the strategic positions of the ports of Itaqui, and New Orleans as supply ports, and Sines, Lisbon, Gijon, Tarragona, Casablanca, and Antwerp as distribution (transshipment) ports in the design of the networks according to the objectives. The advantageous position of Port of Sines is analyzed and discussed according to the aims of this work of building intermodal Supply Chain Networks.
