摘要: Confidentiality of data is essential in numerous collaborative distributed applications, such as supply chain management, where multiple enterprises work together under Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to deliver various services. To effectively deploy distributed applications across different collaborating enterprises, a blockchain system must support both the internal transactions of each enterprise and the cross-enterprise transactions that signify their collaboration. While cross-enterprise transaction data should be accessible to all involved enterprises, each enterprise’s internal data, accessed through internal transactions, may be confidential. To achieve confidentiality, various approaches have been proposed, including cryptographic methods and view-based techniques (such as sharding). Cryptographic techniques involve encrypting or hashing data to prevent unauthorized access by irrelevant parties. In contrast, view-based methods allow each entity (whether an individual enterprise or a group) to maintain its own view of the data (which includes records accessible to that entity), thereby eliminating the necessity for cryptographic solutions. This chapter presents Caper, a permissioned blockchain system designed to facilitate both internal and cross-enterprise transactions among collaborating distributed enterprises. Within Caper, each enterprise independently orders and executes its internal transactions locally while ensuring that cross-enterprise transactions remain public and visible to all participating entities. Furthermore, Caper’s blockchain ledger takes the form of a directed acyclic graph that encapsulates every enterprise’s internal transactions alongside all cross-enterprise transactions. To ensure confidentiality in this structure, no single node maintains the complete blockchain ledger; instead, each enterprise retains its own local representation of the ledger that includes both its internal and all cross-enterprise transactions. Given that global consensus is required for ordering cross-enterprise transactions among all enterprises involved in collaboration, Caper implements various consensus protocols aimed at achieving this global order efficiently.
