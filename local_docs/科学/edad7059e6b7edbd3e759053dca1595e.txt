摘要: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) are pivotal in advancing telecommunications, data centers, and many other high-tech industries. However, traditional 2D PICs face several significant challenges that limit their performance and scalability. This chapter explores the limitations of 2D PICs, focusing on issues related to integration density, interconnection length, and overall performance.
