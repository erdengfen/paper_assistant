摘要: Ports are one of the least sustainable places in the world. Port operations’ negative externalities contribute significantly to global warming, representing a threat especially to human and animal communities living nearby. Simultaneously, ports, alongside coastal areas, are starting to be seriously affected by climate change hazards, with numerous environmental and economic implications. This paper investigates different climate change resilience strategies to be implemented in the port context, arguing for the importance of such action beings ports the direct stakeholders of climate change from both sides of the same coin. Through a comprehensive and organic approach, it analyses five different lines of action aimed at reducing the negative externalities of port’s operations, enhancing port’s climate resilience and protecting the surrounding environment: adaptation, mitigation, soft measures, nature-based solutions and digitalization. Finally, it explores the case study of the port of Rotterdam, an excellent example of a committed port in terms of climate resilience, ultimately demonstrating the efficiency and validity of a holistic approach to climate change resilience in the port context in terms of emissions reduction and environment resilience.
