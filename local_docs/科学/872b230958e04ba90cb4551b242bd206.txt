摘要: The UN's 2050 biodiversity vision aims to achieve thriving ecosystems, reduced species extinction risks, and long-term benefits for humanity. Climate change and biodiversity loss are interlinked global challenges that demand urgent and comprehensive action. Local ecological networks support both climate change adaptation and biodiversity protection by fostering interconnected green spaces that enhance ecosystem resilience. Through targeted policies and nature-based solutions, such as native reforestation and wildlife corridors, these networks mitigate extreme climate events and support species survival. This contribution illustrates the activities of the Province of Potenza in the planning of ecological networks, updating the Provincial Structural Plan as a government tool, seeking strategies for multi-functional development of the territory. With the increase in catastrophic weather events, the identification of new strategies and new tools assumes an important role in adapting to climate change and the challenges that changes in society reflect on the territory. The Province of Potenza is actively involved in European projects promoting participatory governance, territorial resilience, and sustainable ecosystem management, contributing to integrated and lasting environmental transformation.
