摘要: The contribution is elaborated within the framework of Urban Living Lab (ULL), concerned with the right to the city, co-production processes and collective management models for public resources in complex decision contexts. We present the adopted value-focused thinking methodology and the results regarding the first implemented phase of the PS-U-GO Urban Living Lab Naples “Towards a free and accessible sea”. It is one of the four ULLs implemented within the Erasmus+ project “PS-U-GO - Education in Living Labs: Participatory Skills for Sustainable Urban Governance”, and it aims at contributing to the process of re-appropriation, democratisation and return of the sea to the city. This experimentation takes place in continuity with the action-research process developed by CNR IRISS in collaboration with Lido Pola - Urban Commons to monitor and implement urban regeneration processes in the Bagnoli neighborhood in Naples, Italy. It is an ongoing experience that involves actors of the quintuple helix: researchers, scholars and students; civic committees, urban commons and associations; public administrations and private; and last but not least, the sea.
