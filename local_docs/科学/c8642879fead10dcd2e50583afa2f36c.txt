摘要: Exploring Slow Tourism: Integrating Mobility, Heritage, and Landscape Regeneration This study explores the feasibility of slow and sustainable tourism to enhance cultural and natural heritage while fostering connections between coastal and inland territories. By promoting non-motorized mobility , such as cycling and walking, slow tourism offers an alternative to conventional car-based travel, encouraging deeper engagement with landscapes, local traditions, and historical sites. Focusing on different environments, the study examines how slow itineraries can cross mountainous regions, rural areas, and coastal ecosystems, creating a seamless link between urban centres and remote landscapes. These routes reveal the hidden potential of underutilized spaces, transforming abandoned sites into rest stops, cultural hubs, or meditation areas, while also supporting local economies and community-led initiatives. Slow travel itineraries  revitalize fragile landscapes and promote environmental awareness and responsible tourism practices by integrating natural conservation with sustainable tourism. From forested reserves to coastal lagoons and historic villages, these journeys immerse travellers in the ecological and cultural richness of the territory. Beyond recreation, the study highlights how investing in infrastructure, safety and services can strengthen vulnerable regions, fostering resilient and interconnected communities. Slow tourism thus emerges as a powerful tool for territorial regeneration, sustainable mobility, and heritage conservation, redefining how people engage with places and local cultures.
