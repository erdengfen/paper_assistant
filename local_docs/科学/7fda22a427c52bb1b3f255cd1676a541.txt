摘要: Regulatory compliance is essential for organization as it ensures adherence to national laws, policies, and international standards. In South Africa, regulatory compliance is a critical challenge for public organizations, particularly in the face of evolving regulatory framework landscape. This study explores how the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance compliance processes in public organizations. It identifies contextual challenges and barriers influencing their integration and key outcomes. Using a qualitative research approach, the study employs semi-structured interviews with 15 purposively sampled participants in a public organization. The findings reveal that, while advanced technologies offer significant opportunities for streamlining compliance, lowering costs, and improving transparency, their effective integration and application are hindered by contextual factors such as outdated and siloed data systems that cannot support advanced compliance requirements, limited digital literacy skills, and insufficient leadership advocacy. The application of the Technology-Organization-Environment framework offers a structured approach analyzing the interplay between the three dimensions and their influence on the integration of advanced technologies to improve regulatory compliance of public organizations. It fills the gap between technological adoption and sustainable governance by providing a road map for leveraging technology to improve compliance efficiency while addressing systemic issues. The study aligns with the main theme of Sustainable Digital Intelligent Frontiers  by demonstrating how advanced technologies like AI can drive sustainable development in the public sector. By enhancing regulatory compliance, these technologies not only improve operational efficiency but also foster transparency, accountability, and trust – key pillars of sustainable governance.
