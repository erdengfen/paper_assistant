摘要: This study explores the transformative potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational frameworks, focusing on the development and implementation of ViTA (Virtual Teaching Assistant), which is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4. Motivated by the need to enhance interactive learning and improve the relevance of course content delivery, ViTA is designed to provide real-time, adaptive support tailored to a course on machine learning and natural language processing. The deployment of ViTA aims to revolutionize student engagement and learning processes by offering intelligent, context-aware interactions. Utilizing a structured methodological approach, the impact of ViTA on student learning experiences was evaluated through surveys conducted before and after the course integration. These assessments focused on key areas such as student engagement, problem-solving accuracy, and the relevance of AI-generated responses to the curriculum. Statistical analyses using methods like the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and McNemar Test revealed that ViTA significantly improved learning efficiency and student interactivity. Despite the benefits observed, instances of response irrelevance highlighted the ongoing need to refine AI tools to better align with educational objectives. This study not only confirms the effectiveness of AI-driven virtual assistants in enhancing educational outcomes but also proposes continued advancements and deeper integration of AI technologies to enrich diverse learning environments.
