摘要: The goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is to limit rises in global temperatures to less than 2 °C, preferably 1.5 °C. Significant emission reductions are required to achieve this aim. Emissions are predicted to range from their 2016 level of roughly 52 GtCO_2e to between 52 and 58 GtCO_2e by 2030. This chapter explores a number of low and zero-carbon renewable fuels as alternative solutions for providing a way to rebalance transition paths in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement while also reaping the benefits of other sustainability targets. The cytotoxic effects and potential health risks of exhaust emissions from carbon–neutral fuels, particularly biodiesel and their blends is also addressed.
