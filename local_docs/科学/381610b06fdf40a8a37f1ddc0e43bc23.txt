摘要: Biogas production is a process that converts organic materials into a mixture of gases, primarily methane (CH_4) and carbon dioxide (CO_2), through the action of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen. This process, known as anaerobic digestion (AD), has garnered increasing recognition as a sustainable method for generating renewable energy and addressing global waste management challenges.
