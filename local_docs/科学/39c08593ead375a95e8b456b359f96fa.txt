摘要: A variety of therapies are used in stroke rehabilitation to help patients regain abilities that they may have lost following a stroke. Virtual hand exercises present a low-cost approach to enabling stroke patients to embark on immersive journeys to do hand movement via immersive virtual reality (IVR). With technological advancements, ongoing evaluation and integration of the latest IVR innovations will be crucial to maximizing their potential in enhancing the quality of life for individuals with mobility disorders and stroke survivors. A total of 68 participants took part in our study, followed by a design thinking process. Using Unity software, we developed a VR gamified system that allows users to enter a museum and feel, enjoy, track, and explore a VR-based painting (Mona Lisa Frame and The Art Basel Banana) as game elements. These lead to moving or holding the VR-based painting as a hand exercise. We tested the VR gamified system on relevant stakeholders (patients and their relatives and physiotherapists), where they filled out a qualitative survey and a quantitative SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaire. The result of the study showed that the usability effect of the game elements was positive in the context of user satisfaction in supporting virtual hand exercises.
