摘要: Access to energy is a crucial global challenge that influences economic development, environmental sustainability, and social equity. Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) have emerged as a transformative model to promote local engagement in renewable energy initiatives, particularly in rural and marginalized areas. This study examines the role of RECs in Inner Areas, with a specific focus on Sardinia, Italy, highlighting their potential to enhance local energy security, reduce costs, and foster economic revitalization. While European and national policies, such as the Green Deal and the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), have allocated funds to support RECs, their implementation in Inner Areas remains limited due to regulatory complexities, administrative hurdles, and financial constraints. By presenting the REC design process in this context, the study explores both the opportunities and critical challenges that persist. To assess the feasibility of RECs, we propose a multi-scenario simulator designed to support decision-making by performing hourly calculations of energy flows, financial cash flows, and environmental benefits. This tool enables a preliminary evaluation of REC profitability by simulating different community configurations and considering key variables such as energy production, self-consumption, storage dynamics, and surplus energy management in compliance with Italian regulations. The study highlights the importance of strengthening institutional support, enhancing community education, and developing policy frameworks that facilitate the creation of collaborative territorial networks.
