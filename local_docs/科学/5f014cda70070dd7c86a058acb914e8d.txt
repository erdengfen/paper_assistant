摘要: Today’s large-scale data management systems need to address distributed applications’ confidentiality and scalability requirements among a set of collaborative enterprises. The previous chapter discusses Caper, a permissioned blockchain system to guarantee the confidentiality of enterprises in collaboration workflows. Caper supports collaborative enterprises and provides confidentiality by maintaining a partial view of the global ledger on each enterprise. While Caper’s solution is simple and suitable for collaboration workflows with internal and public transactions, Caper does not support (1) confidential collaboration among subsets of enterprises (i.e., it only supports internal or public transactions), (2) data consistency across collaboration workflows that an enterprise is involved in, (3) data confidentiality in the presence of malicious nodes, and (4) multi-shard enterprises. This chapter presents Qanaat, a more generalized confidentiality solution for scalable multi-enterprise applications. Qanaat presents data collections that enable any subset of enterprises involved in a collaboration workflow to keep their collaboration private from other enterprises. A transaction ordering scheme is also presented to enforce only the necessary and sufficient constraints on transaction order to guarantee data consistency. Furthermore, Qanaat supports data consistency across collaboration workflows where an enterprise can participate in different collaboration workflows with different sets of enterprises. Finally, Qanaat presents a suite of consensus protocols to support intra-shard and cross-shard transactions within or across enterprises.
