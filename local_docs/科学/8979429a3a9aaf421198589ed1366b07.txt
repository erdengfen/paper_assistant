摘要: Technological developments across the wide range of low-carbon energy solutions are progressing rapidly, with ongoing innovations in renewable electricity generation, industrial processes and energy-saving technologies and services. Combining renewable electricity with biotic and abiotic pathways to produce chemicals, fuels and materials promises to deliver new solutions. In order to achieve environmental sustainability put forth by European Union key drivers of decarbonisation will be addressed in this chapter. The carbon capture and storage, green fuels production and in electrification systems raising the share of sustainable energy sources as well as energy efficiency will be explained.
