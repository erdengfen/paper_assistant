摘要: The integration of 3D photonics into telecommunications and data centers marks a transformative advancement, enabling far greater data transmission speeds, processing capabilities, and energy efficiency compared to traditional 2D photonic solutions. By utilizing vertical stacking of photonic components, 3D photonics allows for denser integration and shorter interconnects, reducing latency and minimizing signal loss—a crucial improvement for the high-speed demands of data centers and telecommunication networks.
