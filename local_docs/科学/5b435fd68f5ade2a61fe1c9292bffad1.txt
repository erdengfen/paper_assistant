摘要: The paper is focused on the geometric numerical integration of port-Hamiltonian problems, via discrete gradient $$\theta $$ θ -methods. The ability of this method to retain inherent dissipativity properties of the exact dynamics is considered, as well as the stability properties of the numerical scheme with respect to a test problem based on a controlled pendulum are treated. The analysis is also equipped by selected numerical experiments.
