摘要: This research examines the concept of the human-scale city, developing a technique applicable to neighbourhoods to enhance their sustainability, liveability, walkability, well-being, and the happiness perceived by residents. This study aims to show the importance of an interdisciplinary approach by addressing the methodological gap prevalent in traditional literature that underscores the division between the examination of urban infrastructures, typically within the engineering domain, and the analysis of social dynamics, a focus in a sociology domain. This separation has historically limited the comprehension of the complex processes that influence cities and the experiences of their residents. The methodology adopted for assessing proximity and urban happiness combines qualitative approaches with quantitative studies, including the establishment of indices and indicators directly associated with neighbourhood liveability. This work facilitated the integration of empirical data with the subjective perceptions experienced by users of urban places regarding proximity, safety, comfort, well-being, and pleasure experienced at urban spaces. The application of this approach examined in the San Benedetto neighbourhood of Cagliari (Italy) highlighted the importance of the emotional dimension in evaluating the design effectiveness of an urban environment, aiding in the conceptualisation of an ideal “Happy City” model. This study demonstrates the model’s applicability in many urban contexts, emphasising that the realisation of a “A Smart, and Happy City” requires a comprehensive and coordinated spatial approach.
