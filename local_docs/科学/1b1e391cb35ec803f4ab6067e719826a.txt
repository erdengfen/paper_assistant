摘要: Preserving cultural heritage plays a crucial role in sustaining the identities of communities and individuals while also nurturing belonging, civic participation, and collective memory. This paper explores the application of gamification as a tool for enhancing community engagement in the valorisation of cultural heritage. It addresses the need for innovative strategies to promote active participation and foster a sense of belonging, contributing to sustainable and inclusive development models. The research investigates the potential of gamification to bridge the gap between local communities, cultural heritage sites, and relevant stakeholders on a local level. A methodology for assessing the impact of gamification projects is presented, drawing upon a pilot study focused on the Colommunity project in Bacoli, Italy. A game-based collaborative decision-making approach has been implemented to encourage the co-exploration and co-management of the Colombario del Fusaro, an ancient Roman funerary site, which is currently completely inaccessible due to the absence of a suitable management plan. The study integrates the gamification approach with the Theory of Change to analyse the relationship between project activities, outputs, outcomes, and resulting social and cultural impacts. The findings highlight the effectiveness of gamification in creating engaging experiences that motivate community involvement in cultural heritage. The research emphasises the importance of co-creation processes that involve local communities, experts, and institutions to ensure the development of valuable and sustainable initiatives. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about the long-term impact of gamification in the cultural heritage sector.
