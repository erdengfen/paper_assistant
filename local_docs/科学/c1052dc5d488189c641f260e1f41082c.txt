摘要: This teaching practice research addresses the rapid growth of information technology, the widespread use of online learning, and the digital transformation accelerated by COVID-19. It examines the gap between the Ministry of Education’s digital course certification standards and students’ sustainable self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies. An experimental intervention was implemented in the master's distance course Business Research Methods, integrating five modules: learning strategies, metacognitive assessments, reflective activities, motivation enhancement, and resource management, combined with project-based learning (PBL).Using a quasi-experimental design, data were collected through questionnaires, semester grades, teaching evaluations, and interviews to assess SRL, collaborative learning, communication, professional competence, and problem-solving skills. Despite a structured design, results fell short of expectations: of 11 students, 7 withdrew, and no significant improvements were found between pre- and post-tests. EMI (English as a Medium of Instruction) delivery added cognitive load, reducing motivation and engagement. The Ministry’s certification review identified three deficiencies: insufficient self-produced instructional videos, weak asynchronous discussion design, and limited peer interaction. The instructor’s reflection suggests future adjustments: reduce course difficulty, balance demands with student capacity, increase self-produced content, strengthen discussions, and consider using non-EMI instruction. Greater emphasis on pre-course motivation-building, psychological preparation, and incentive mechanisms is also recommended to encourage active participation and support the internalization of sustainable SRL strategies.
