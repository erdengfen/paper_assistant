摘要: The High-Speed Rail (HSR) is the new mode of transport and is an opportunity for the sustainable development of the territory it crosses. HSR is an indispensable link to increase social and economic development and an opportunity to environmental sustainability. Transport net reshape the landscape and defines new distributions of functional areas on the territory. The HSR Stations (ST) are the fundamental nodes of connection with the territorial system. This document analyses existing HSR ST with the aim of outlining the uniform characteristics and the specific characteristics found. This working method allows to define, a basic criterion to be applied in the planning process for new potential HSR ST. It is considered that the synthesis of uniform characteristics and specific characteristics can be useful, validated and replicable reference for potential new HSR ST that the planning process will locate. The main elements characterizing the reference criterion for the choice of a potential high-speed station were applied to the case study of Gioia Tauro. The planning process can use these categories to decide on the location of potential HSR ST. The integrated smart process allows to plan the transformations caused by the new infrastructure node. The planning process leads towards sustainable development of the territory and the composition of new quality landscapes. The paper understands the importance of HSR and proposes some useful references to the smart process for sustainable development of the territory and new quality landscapes by means of new stations. As a result of HSR, the territory becomes sustainable and smart.
