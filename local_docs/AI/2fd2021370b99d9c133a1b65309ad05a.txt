摘要: We present a logical framework to represent and reason about fuzzy
optimization problems based on fuzzy answer set optimization programming. This
is accomplished by allowing fuzzy optimization aggregates, e.g., minimum and
maximum in the language of fuzzy answer set optimization programming to allow
minimization or maximization of some desired criteria under fuzzy environments.
We show the application of the proposed logical fuzzy optimization framework
under the fuzzy answer set optimization programming to the fuzzy water
allocation optimization problem.
