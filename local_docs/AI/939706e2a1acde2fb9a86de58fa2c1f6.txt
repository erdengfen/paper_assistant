摘要: This paper investigates quantum machine learning to optimize the beamforming
in a multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink system. We aim to combine
the power of quantum neural networks and the success of classical deep neural
networks to enhance the learning performance. Specifically, we propose two
hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to maximize the sum rate of a downlink
system. The first one proposes a quantum neural network employing parameterized
quantum circuits that follows a classical convolutional neural network. The
classical neural network can be jointly trained with the quantum neural network
or pre-trained leading to a fine-tuning transfer learning method. The second
one designs a quantum convolutional neural network to better extract features
followed by a classical deep neural network. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed hybrid neural networks, and reveal that the first
method can achieve similar sum rate performance compared to a benchmark
classical neural network with significantly less training parameters; while the
second method can achieve higher sum rate especially in presence of many users
still with less training parameters. The robustness of the proposed methods is
verified using both software simulators and hardware emulators considering
noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.
