摘要: Understanding the impact of data set design on model training and performance
can help alleviate the costs associated with generating remote sensing and
overhead labeled data. This work examined the impact of training shifted window
transformers using bounding boxes and segmentation labels, where the latter are
more expensive to produce. We examined classification tasks by comparing models
trained with both target and backgrounds against models trained with only
target pixels, extracted by segmentation labels. For object detection models,
we compared performance using either label type when training. We found that
the models trained on only target pixels do not show performance improvement
for classification tasks, appearing to conflate background pixels in the
evaluation set with target pixels. For object detection, we found that models
trained with either label type showed equivalent performance across testing. We
found that bounding boxes appeared to be sufficient for tasks that did not
require more complex labels, such as object segmentation. Continuing work to
determine consistency of this result across data types and model architectures
could potentially result in substantial savings in generating remote sensing
data sets for deep learning.
