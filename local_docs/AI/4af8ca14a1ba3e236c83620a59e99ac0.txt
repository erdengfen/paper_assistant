摘要: In this article, we proposed a partition:wise robust loss function based on
the previous robust loss function. The characteristics of this loss function
are that it achieves high robustness and a wide range of applicability through
partition-wise design and adaptive parameter adjustment. Finally, the
advantages and development potential of this loss function were verified by
applying this loss function to the regression question and using five different
datasets (with different dimensions, different sample numbers, and different
fields) to compare with the other loss functions. The results of multiple
experiments have proven the advantages of our loss function .
