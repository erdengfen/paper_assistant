摘要: As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT become increasingly integrated
into our everyday lives--from customer service and education to creative work
and personal productivity--understanding how people interact with these AI
systems has become a pressing issue. Despite the widespread use of LLMs,
researchers lack standardized tools for systematically studying people's
interactions with LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce GPT for Researchers
(G4R), or g4r.org, a free website that researchers can use to easily create and
integrate a GPT Interface into their studies. At g4r.org, researchers can (1)
enable their study participants to interact with GPT (such as ChatGPT), (2)
customize GPT Interfaces to guide participants' interactions with GPT (e.g.,
set constraints on topics or adjust GPT's tone or response style), and (3)
capture participants' interactions with GPT by downloading data on messages
exchanged between participants and GPT. By facilitating study participants'
interactions with GPT and providing detailed data on these interactions, G4R
can support research on topics such as consumer interactions with AI agents or
LLMs, AI-assisted decision-making, and linguistic patterns in human-AI
communication. With this goal in mind, we provide a step-by-step guide to using
G4R at g4r.org.
