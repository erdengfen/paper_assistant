摘要: This paper studies stochastic optimization problems with polynomials. We
propose an optimization model with sample averages and perturbations. The
Lasserre type Moment-SOS relaxations are used to solve the sample average
optimization. Properties of the optimization and its relaxations are studied.
Numerical experiments are presented.
