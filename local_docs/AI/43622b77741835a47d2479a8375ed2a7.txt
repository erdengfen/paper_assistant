摘要: As a pivotal extension of the renowned ChatGPT, the GPT Store serves as a
dynamic marketplace for various Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)
models, shaping the frontier of conversational AI. This paper presents an
in-depth measurement study of the GPT Store, with a focus on the categorization
of GPTs by topic, factors influencing GPT popularity, and the potential
security risks. Our investigation starts with assessing the categorization of
GPTs in the GPT Store, analyzing how they are organized by topics, and
evaluating the effectiveness of the classification system. We then examine the
factors that affect the popularity of specific GPTs, looking into user
preferences, algorithmic influences, and market trends. Finally, the study
delves into the security risks of the GPT Store, identifying potential threats
and evaluating the robustness of existing security measures. This study offers
a detailed overview of the GPT Store's current state, shedding light on its
operational dynamics and user interaction patterns. Our findings aim to enhance
understanding of the GPT ecosystem, providing valuable insights for future
research, development, and policy-making in generative AI.
