摘要: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) seek to solve partial differential
equations (PDEs) with deep learning. Mainstream approaches that deploy
fully-connected multi-layer deep learning architectures require prolonged
training to achieve even moderate accuracy, while recent work on feature
engineering allows higher accuracy and faster convergence. This paper
introduces SAFE-NET, a Single-layered Adaptive Feature Engineering NETwork that
achieves orders-of-magnitude lower errors with far fewer parameters than
baseline feature engineering methods. SAFE-NET returns to basic ideas in
machine learning, using Fourier features, a simplified single hidden layer
network architecture, and an effective optimizer that improves the conditioning
of the PINN optimization problem. Numerical results show that SAFE-NET
converges faster and typically outperforms deeper networks and more complex
architectures. It consistently uses fewer parameters -- on average, 65% fewer
than the competing feature engineering methods -- while achieving comparable
accuracy in less than 30% of the training epochs. Moreover, each SAFE-NET epoch
is 95% faster than those of competing feature engineering approaches. These
findings challenge the prevailing belief that modern PINNs effectively learn
features in these scientific applications and highlight the efficiency gains
possible through feature engineering.
