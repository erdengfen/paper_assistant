摘要: We present the OpenAI Remote Rendering Backend (ORRB), a system that allows
fast and customizable rendering of robotics environments. It is based on the
Unity3d game engine and interfaces with the MuJoCo physics simulation library.
ORRB was designed with visual domain randomization in mind. It is optimized for
cloud deployment and high throughput operation. We are releasing it to the
public under a liberal MIT license: https://github.com/openai/orrb .
