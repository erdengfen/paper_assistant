摘要: To train deep convolutional neural networks, the input data and the
intermediate activations need to be kept in memory to calculate the gradient
descent step. Given the limited memory available in the current generation
accelerator cards, this limits the maximum dimensions of the input data. We
demonstrate a method to train convolutional neural networks holding only parts
of the image in memory while giving equivalent results. We quantitatively
compare this new way of training convolutional neural networks with
conventional training. In addition, as a proof of concept, we train a
convolutional neural network with 64 megapixel images, which requires 97% less
memory than the conventional approach.
