摘要: We introduce a new paradigm to investigate unsupervised learning, reducing
unsupervised learning to supervised learning. Specifically, we mitigate the
subjectivity in unsupervised decision-making by leveraging knowledge acquired
from prior, possibly heterogeneous, supervised learning tasks. We demonstrate
the versatility of our framework via comprehensive expositions and detailed
experiments on several unsupervised problems such as (a) clustering, (b)
outlier detection, and (c) similarity prediction under a common umbrella of
meta-unsupervised-learning. We also provide rigorous PAC-agnostic bounds to
establish the theoretical foundations of our framework, and show that our
framing of meta-clustering circumvents Kleinberg's impossibility theorem for
clustering.
