摘要: OpenAI's advanced large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural
language processing and enabled developers to create innovative applications.
As adoption grows, understanding the experiences and challenges of developers
working with these technologies is crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of the OpenAI Developer Forum, focusing on (1) popularity trends and
user engagement patterns, and (2) a taxonomy of challenges and concerns faced
by developers. We first employ a quantitative analysis of the metadata from
29,576 forum topics, investigating temporal trends in topic creation, the
popularity of topics across different categories, and user contributions at
various trust levels. We then qualitatively analyze content from 9,301 recently
active topics on developer concerns. From a sample of 886 topics, we construct
a taxonomy of concerns in the OpenAI Developer Forum. Our findings uncover
critical concerns raised by developers in creating AI-powered applications and
offer targeted recommendations to address them. This work not only advances
AI-assisted software engineering but also empowers developer communities to
shape the responsible evolution and integration of AI technology in society.
