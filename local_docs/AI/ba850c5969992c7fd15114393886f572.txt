摘要: Optimization problems with both control variables and environmental variables
arise in many fields. This paper introduces a framework of personalized
optimization to han- dle such problems. Unlike traditional robust optimization,
personalized optimization devotes to finding a series of optimal control
variables for different values of environmental variables. Therefore, the
solution from personalized optimization consists of optimal surfaces defined on
the domain of the environmental variables. When the environmental variables can
be observed or measured, personalized optimization yields more reasonable and
better solution- s than robust optimization. The implementation of personalized
optimization for complex computer models is discussed. Based on statistical
modeling of computer experiments, we provide two algorithms to sequentially
design input values for approximating the optimal surfaces. Numerical examples
show the effectiveness of our algorithms.
