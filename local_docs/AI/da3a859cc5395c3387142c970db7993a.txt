摘要: OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for reinforcement learning research. It includes a
growing collection of benchmark problems that expose a common interface, and a
website where people can share their results and compare the performance of
algorithms. This whitepaper discusses the components of OpenAI Gym and the
design decisions that went into the software.
