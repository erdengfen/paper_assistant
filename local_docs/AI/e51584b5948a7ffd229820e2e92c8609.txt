摘要: Time series forecasting based on deep architectures has been gaining
popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex non-linear
temporal dynamics. The recurrent neural network is one such model capable of
handling variable-length input and output. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in deep generative models and the concept of state space models to
propose a stochastic adaptation of the recurrent neural network for
multistep-ahead time series forecasting, which is trained with stochastic
gradient variational Bayes. In our model design, the transition function of the
recurrent neural network, which determines the evolution of the hidden states,
is stochastic rather than deterministic as in a regular recurrent neural
network; this is achieved by incorporating a latent random variable into the
transition process which captures the stochasticity of the temporal dynamics.
Our model preserves the architectural workings of a recurrent neural network
for which all relevant information is encapsulated in its hidden states, and
this flexibility allows our model to be easily integrated into any deep
architecture for sequential modelling. We test our model on a wide range of
datasets from finance to healthcare; results show that the stochastic recurrent
neural network consistently outperforms its deterministic counterpart.
