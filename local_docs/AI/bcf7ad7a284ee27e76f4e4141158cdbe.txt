摘要: The standard loss functions used in the literature on probabilistic
prediction are the log loss function, the Brier loss function, and the
spherical loss function; however, any computable proper loss function can be
used for comparison of prediction algorithms. This note shows that the log loss
function is most selective in that any prediction algorithm that is optimal for
a given data sequence (in the sense of the algorithmic theory of randomness)
under the log loss function will be optimal under any computable proper mixable
loss function; on the other hand, there is a data sequence and a prediction
algorithm that is optimal for that sequence under either of the two other
standard loss functions but not under the log loss function.
