摘要: These lecture notes provide an overview of Neural Network architectures from
a mathematical point of view. Especially, Machine Learning with Neural Networks
is seen as an optimization problem. Covered are an introduction to Neural
Networks and the following architectures: Feedforward Neural Network,
Convolutional Neural Network, ResNet, and Recurrent Neural Network.
