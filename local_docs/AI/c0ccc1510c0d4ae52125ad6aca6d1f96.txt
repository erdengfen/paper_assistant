摘要: A lifelong reinforcement learning system is a learning system that has the
ability to learn through trail-and-error interaction with the environment over
its lifetime. In this paper, I give some arguments to show that the traditional
reinforcement learning paradigm fails to model this type of learning system.
Some insights into lifelong reinforcement learning are provided, along with a
simplistic prototype lifelong reinforcement learning system.
