摘要: This paper presents the ADAIO team's system entry in the Building Educational
Applications (BEA) 2023 Shared Task on Generating AI Teacher Responses in
Educational Dialogues. The task aims to assess the performance of
state-of-the-art generative models as AI teachers in producing suitable
responses within a student-teacher dialogue. Our system comprises evaluating
various baseline models using OpenAI GPT-3 and designing diverse prompts to
prompt the OpenAI models for teacher response generation. After the challenge,
our system achieved second place by employing a few-shot prompt-based approach
with the OpenAI text-davinci-003 model. The results highlight the few-shot
learning capabilities of large-language models, particularly OpenAI's GPT-3, in
the role of AI teachers.
