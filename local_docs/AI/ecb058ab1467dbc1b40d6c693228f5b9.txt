摘要: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), represented by
OpenAI's GPT series, has significantly impacted various domains such as natural
language processing, software development, education, healthcare, finance, and
scientific research. However, OpenAI APIs introduce unique challenges that
differ from traditional APIs, such as the complexities of prompt engineering,
token-based cost management, non-deterministic outputs, and operation as black
boxes. To the best of our knowledge, the challenges developers encounter when
using OpenAI APIs have not been explored in previous empirical studies. To fill
this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study by analyzing 2,874
OpenAI API-related discussions from the popular Q&A forum Stack Overflow. We
first examine the popularity and difficulty of these posts. After manually
categorizing them into nine OpenAI API-related categories, we identify specific
challenges associated with each category through topic modeling analysis. Based
on our empirical findings, we finally propose actionable implications for
developers, LLM vendors, and researchers.
