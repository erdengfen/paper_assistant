摘要: Neural network model compression techniques can address the computation issue
of deep neural networks on embedded devices in industrial systems. The
guaranteed output error computation problem for neural network compression with
quantization is addressed in this paper. A merged neural network is built from
a feedforward neural network and its quantized version to produce the exact
output difference between two neural networks. Then, optimization-based methods
and reachability analysis methods are applied to the merged neural network to
compute the guaranteed quantization error. Finally, a numerical example is
proposed to validate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed
approach.
