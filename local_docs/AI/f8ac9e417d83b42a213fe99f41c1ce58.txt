摘要: ChatGPT has quickly advanced from simple natural language processing to
tackling more sophisticated and specialized tasks. Drawing inspiration from the
success of mobile app ecosystems, OpenAI allows developers to create
applications that interact with third-party services, known as GPTs. GPTs can
choose to leverage third-party services to integrate with specialized APIs for
domain-specific applications. However, the way these disclose privacy setting
information limits accessibility and analysis, making it challenging to
systematically evaluate the data privacy implications of third-party integrate
to GPTs. In order to support academic research on the integration of
third-party services in GPTs, we introduce GPTs-ThirdSpy, an automated
framework designed to extract privacy settings of GPTs. GPTs-ThirdSpy provides
academic researchers with real-time, reliable metadata on third-party services
used by GPTs, enabling in-depth analysis of their integration, compliance, and
potential security risks. By systematically collecting and structuring this
data, GPTs-ThirdSpy facilitates large-scale research on the transparency and
regulatory challenges associated with the GPT app ecosystem.
